class Connection:
	"""
	Written by Kaustubh Karkare.
	The connection class aims to provide an extremely simple way to set up TCP/UDP Servers/Clients.
	Connections are creating using the statement similar to:
		link = connection({ "name":"TCP-Client", "host":"192.168.0.1", "port":12345, "type":"tcp", "role":"client", "handler":somefunction })
	The "name", "host", "port", "type" and "role" key-value pairs are non-optional. Each of these, along with the additional options are described:
		name : The name of the connection which used to identify it during debugging. It is recommended that you provide a unique name to each connection. In case of a server, each accepted connection is named by suffixing the remote host and port addresses to the name of the server connection.
		host : The IP Address or Host Name (which should be DNS resolvable) to which a connection is to be made (in clients) or at which incoming connections/data are/is to be recieved (in servers).
		port : The Port Number to be connected to (in clients) or listened at (in servers).
		type : Type of connection, must be either "tcp" or "udp".
		role : Role of this connection, muct be either "server" or "client".
		handler : A function that will be called whenever new data is recieved, described in more detail later.
		debug : A file-like object to which all debugging messages will be sent, with the connection name suffixed (default value = None).
		family : Type of socket family, must be "ipv4".
		maxconn : The maximum number of connections that a server should handle at a time. The server rejects any additional incoming connections (default value = 10).
		poll : The amount of time between checks for new data, in seconds (default value = 1).
		buffer : The size of the data that is to be read from the stream, in bytes (default value = 1024).
	Handler Functions:
		In case of a TCP-Server, whenever a client tries to set up a connection to it, a new TCP-Client-type connection object is created, and the handler function is passed down.
		In case of a TCP-Client, whenever new data is recieved, the handler function is called with three arguments: data (which was just recieved), info and args (a dictionary that contains additional data to be passed to this function is specified during creation of the connection).
			The info argument contains a dictionary containing useful information about the connection like remote host, port and pointers to functions to send data to the remote host, to terminate the client connection, and to kill the spawning server too.
			Whatever this function returns will be saved in the connection as args, and provided to it during the next function call. If args is a dictionary, and contains a key "binary", whose value is True, logging of recieved TCP data is disabled, until this is changed. This is useful while transferring large amounts of binary data.
			In case the data to be recieved exceeded the buffer-size, it is the responsibility of the handler function to keep records and append the different pieces together.
			The handler function call in case of a TCP-Client is blocking - no new data will be read from the stream till the function returns.
			There are however two exceptional cases where the above rules do not apply: When the connection is initially established, or is being terminated, this function will be called with the data argument set to None. Note however, that the termination call is unreliable.
		In case of UDP-Servers, the handler function is defined the same way is that of the TCP-Client.
			The return value of this function is ignored completely, as it would only create problems due to the multithreaded nature in which is is called.
			However, it is non-blocking - each handler function call has its own thread and therefore, the function must be thread-safe.
		In case of UDP-Clients, the handler function is not required, and may be omitted from the constructor itself.
	The various functions that are available to you for use are (the self argument has been omitted for simplicity's sake in the following list):
		__init__(data): Takes a dictionary type object and calls configure(data), followed by setup()
		configure(data):
			Verifies the values provided in the dictionary type object provided and makes the connection ready for use.
			All Configuration variables MUST be set using the configure() function.
			If the connection was active when you change the Configuration, the original connection will be lost, and a new one will be automatically setup. You may continue to use the same connection object.
		setup(): 
			The setup() function establishes links with the server (if you are setting up a client) or starts listening for connections on the given port.
			In a server, an infinite loop (that can be terminated using the close() function) begins that checks for incoming connections and creates a new client object when they do to interact with them.
			In a client, a similar infinite loop (terminated using close()) keeps checking for data that is recieved from the remote system.
			This function is non-blocking as the above loops are run in a parallel thread.
		info(): Returns a string describing the connection.
		active(): Returns a boolean value that indicates whether or not the connection is active.
		clients(): Returns a boolean value that indicates whether or not this TCP Server has had or still has active connections with clients.
		send(): Sends data over the connection to the remote host, as specified in the Configuration.
		wait(): Suspends execution (in the calling thread) until this connection is terminated.
		close():
			In case of a TCP Server, closing the connection (using close()) would result in the closing of all objects that were created in response to clients that connected to this server.
			This process is blocking - execution is suspended until the termination process is complete.
	Error Codes:
		1 : Missing option required for Configuration.
		2 : Attempt to modify read-only data during Configuration.
		3 : Invalid data provided for options used in Configuration.
		4 : Could not bind to given port as it is already bound to some other connection/socket.
		5 : Could not bind to specified socket.
		6 : Connection terminated by remote host.
